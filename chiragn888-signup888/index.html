To implement the plan for modification, we will add a new link element to the existing HTML structure. Since the provided code does not include a navigation section, we will add the link in a suitable place, such as below the sign-in and sign-up sections. We will ensure that the link is styled consistently with other elements on the page using 'index.css'.

Here is the modified code with the new "Add Enquiry" link added:

```html
<!-- ... existing code ... -->

<p><p id="transmit" class="fp1" style="text-decoration: none">New User? Sign Up</p></p>

<!-- Add Enquiry link added below the New User? Sign Up link -->
<p><a href="enquiry.html" class="fp1" style="text-decoration: none">Add Enquiry</a></p>

<!-- ... existing code ... -->

<!-- ... existing code ... -->

<p><p  id="transmit1" class="fp1" style="text-decoration: none">Existing User? Sign In</p></p>

<!-- Add Enquiry link added below the Existing User? Sign In link -->
<p><a href="enquiry.html" class="fp1" style="text-decoration: none">Add Enquiry</a></p>

<!-- ... existing code ... -->
```

The above code snippet should be placed in the appropriate sections of the 'index.html' file, ensuring that the "Add Enquiry" link is visible and styled in a manner consistent with the rest of the page. The class 'fp1' is used assuming it is already defined in 'index.css' and provides the desired styling. If 'fp1' does not style the link appropriately, you should create a new class in 'index.css' and apply it to the link.
