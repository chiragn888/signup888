To implement the plan for modification, we will add a new 'a' element with the 'href' attribute pointing to 'enquiry.html' and text content "Add Enquiry". We will place this link in a prominent location on the landing page. Given the current structure of the HTML, a suitable place for this link could be right below the "Sign In" and "Sign Up" sections, ensuring it is easily accessible.

Here is the modified code with the new 'a' element added:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/html">
<head>
    <title>Sign-in</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/aos@next/dist/aos.css" />
</head>
<body class="body">
<center>
<div>
  <!-- ... existing code ... -->

  <!-- Add Enquiry Link -->
  <div id="enquiry-link" style="margin-top: 20px;">
    <a href="enquiry.html">Add Enquiry</a>
  </div>
  <!-- End of Add Enquiry Link -->

  <!-- ... existing code ... -->
</div>
</center>

<!-- ... existing scripts ... -->

</body>
</html>
```

I have added a new `div` with the `id` "enquiry-link" to contain the new 'a' element. This ensures that the link is placed in a separate block that can be styled and positioned as needed. The `margin-top` style is added to create some space between the link and the existing content, but this can be adjusted according to the actual styling requirements of the page.
