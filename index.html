To address the plan for modification of the code, I will insert an anchor tag with the text "Add Enquiry" that links to 'enquiry.html'. This link will be placed in a prominent location on the landing page and styled with 'index.css'. Here is the modified section of the HTML code:

```html
<!-- Existing Code Above -->
<center><h1 id="sign-in">Sign In</h1></center>
<!-- Insert the new anchor tag below the Sign In heading -->
<center><a href="enquiry.html" class="enquiry-link">Add Enquiry</a></center>
<center>
<!-- Existing Code Continues Below -->
<div id="border">
```

In the above code snippet, I have added a new anchor tag right below the `<h1>` tag with the id "sign-in". This anchor tag is given a class "enquiry-link" which should be styled in 'index.css'. The link will take users to the 'enquiry.html' page when clicked.

Make sure to add the corresponding styles for the `.enquiry-link` class in 'index.css' to match the styling of the landing page.
