To address the plan for modification of the code, you will need to add a new link to the 'index.html' file. Since the provided code is for a different file, I will provide the necessary HTML snippet that should be added to the 'index.html' file to create the "Add Enquiry" link. This snippet should be placed in a prominent location, such as the navigation bar or near other call-to-action buttons.

Here is the HTML code snippet to add the "Add Enquiry" link:

```html
<!-- Add this snippet in the navigation bar or near other CTA buttons in your index.html file -->
<a href="enquiry.html" class="enquiry-link">Add Enquiry</a>
```

And here is the CSS that should be added to 'index.css' to style the link:

```css
/* Add this CSS to index.css to style the "Add Enquiry" link */
.enquiry-link {
  /* Style properties to match the website's existing design */
  /* Example styles: */
  display: inline-block;
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 8px 15px;
  background-color: #007bff; /* Example background color */
  color: white; /* Example text color */
  text-decoration: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  font-weight: bold;
}

.enquiry-link:hover {
  background-color: #0056b3; /* Darker background color on hover */
  /* Other hover effects */
}
```

Make sure to adjust the example styles provided in the CSS to match your website's existing design. The class name 'enquiry-link' is used to apply the styles specifically to the "Add Enquiry" link. If your website has a predefined class for links or buttons, you may use that class instead to ensure consistent styling.
